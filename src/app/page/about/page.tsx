      <p className="text-[#111418] text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
        My mission is to empower people with the knowledge and skills they need to reach their full potential. I believe that education is the most powerful tool we have for
        creating positive change in the world. As a teacher, I strive to inspire my students to think critically, work collaboratively, and never stop learning. As an author,
        I aim to share ideas that challenge the status quo and spark meaningful conversations. As a speaker, I hope to engage audiences with thought-provoking stories and
        insights. Whether in the classroom, on the page, or on the stage, my goal is to make a lasting impact on how we learn, teach, and grow.

              Connect.me is a real gem and is the site of choice for people with high ambitions. We're meeting people we couldn't have found otherwise, the type of people
              that don't usually apply for roles. My favorite part is that we can highlight our team culture in a way impossible elsewhere. Just having job descriptions is
              antiquated â€” and read.cv fixed that.

              The quality of the portfolios on Connect.me are astounding. Not only due to the seamless design of the pages, but also because of the calibre of talent on the
              network. It was extremely easy to set up both a personal and company profile. I loved how their prompts helped us shine a light on the most human elements of
              Blur.io.
